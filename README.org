~read-time.el~ is a package that calculates how long it takes to read something. It contains one function ~read-time~ and one variable ~read-time-words-per-sec~.

** ~read-time~

An interactive function that uses the region if active, or the whole buffer if not, to calculate the time taken to read it based on a reading speed.

*** Reading speed

The speed can be specified, in order of preference, as a third argument, ~read-time-words-per-sec~, or a default value of 5 words per second.

** Installation

*** Doom Emacs

In ~packages.el~:
#+begin_src elisp
(package! read-time :recipe (:host github :repo "EducatedAlmost/read-time.el"))
#+end_src

In ~config.el~:
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'read-time)
(setq read-time-words-per-sec 6) ;; optional
#+end_src

** Usage

Call ~read-time~ interactively, either with a region or without.

#+begin_src elisp
(read-time (point-min) 300)
(read-time 1 100 3) ;; words-per-sec is an optional argument
#+end_src
